                The evidence is clear: The Articles of Confederation simply do not work. In the aftermath of Shays’ Rebellion, the weaknesses of the Articles have been exposed for all to see. Without a complete reworking of our national government, the United States of America will soon dissolve into anarchy, dashing any hope of transforming the country into a global world power.
                <br><br>
                I shall first explain the factors that doomed the Articles from the moment they were put on paper. Each state had only one vote in the so-called “League of Friendship”, which means that the entirety of Virginia has the same amount of power as Rhode Island. Additionally, a 9/13 majority vote is required to pass any laws. It is of little surprise that Congress has gotten next to nothing done. Also, Congress cannot levy taxes or raise a military. Seriously. How is our federal government supposed to get money if it cannot levy taxes? In their pursuit to create a government free from tyranny, the writers of the Articles of Confederation created a government on the edge of anarchy.
                <br><br>
                The new Constitution, proposed by the Federalists, aims to solve these problems. It creates two houses in Congress, one where each state has members determined by its population, and another where each state has an equal voice. In this way, residents of different states have a more “equal” power in the legislature, but small states will still be able to have their voice heard.
                <br><br>
                While some may worry that a stronger national government could lead to a tyrannical government like the monarchy of England, the Constitution has mechanisms in place to prevent the abuse of government power. These systems, dubbed the “checks and balances”, allow any one of the three new branches of government (Congress, the Executive Branch and the Courts) to undo the actions of the other. For example, the President will be able to reject laws passed by Congress, but Congress can vote to bypass his rejection or to remove him from office. In this way, no one in the government has too much power, so it is much more difficult to abuse power.
                <br><br>
                I strongly believe that a strong federal government is necessary for our growing nation to survive, and that the ratification of the Constitution should be a top national priority. The Constitution will bring peace to our nation, and be a strong foundation upon which the United States can be built.

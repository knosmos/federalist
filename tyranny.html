            <h1>Tyranny Follows the Federalists</h1>
            <p>
                <em>February 16th, 1788</em><br>

                I, and many of my fellow countrymen are concerned about your recent article “Why Federalism Will Work” arguing for the ratification of the Constitution. One of the major problems is the “necessary and proper” clause of the Constitution, which states that Congress can essentially make any laws it wants in order for it to carry out the Powers given to it by the Constitution. By invoking this clause, Congress might be able to stop the states from collecting taxes, which would then cause the state governments to collapse. The states would be left powerless, and the Federal government would then be able to assume all the powers of the states, creating a monolithic, tyrannical national government. This is clearly a very worrying concern. If the Constitution must be ratified, that clause should be removed, or at least amended.

                Additionally, how are we to be assured that our rights to free speech, to peaceful protest, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, will be protected under this new Constitution, which lacks a Bill of Rights? Such a strong national government is a mosquito breeding-ground for tyrannical leaders who suppress criticism of the opposition. We just fought a war for these rights - heck, we even made a new country so we didn’t need to be ruled by a king. Now, you want to create a Constitution, with a “President” who has “executive power” over the government? This seems rather familiar...

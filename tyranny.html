            <h1>Tyranny Follows the Federalists</h1>
            <p>
                <em>February 16th, 1788</em><br>
                <em>James K. Abrams</em>
                <br><br>
                I, and many of my fellow countrymen are concerned about your recent article “Why Federalism Will Work” arguing for the ratification of the Constitution. How are we to be assured that our rights to free speech, to peaceful protest, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, will be protected under this new Constitution? Such a strong national government is a mosquito breeding-ground for tyrannical leaders who suppress criticism of the opposition. We just fought a war for these rights - heck, we even made a new country so we didn’t need to be ruled by a king. Now, you want to create a Constitution, with a “President” who has “executive power” over the government? This seems rather familiar. It would be quite a shame to my fellow soldiers and countrymen if we shed blood and braved the winters just so some rich politicians could seize power over the Colonies.

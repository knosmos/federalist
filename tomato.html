                I was at the market the other day, and I saw that Ol’ Man Hanſon at the market
                raiſed the prices of his tomatoes by one cent a pound! This is prepoſterous!
                How are we, as a nation, suppoſed to grow into a manufacturing superpower if we
                are unable to buy tomatoes to feed our children? I call for a revolution! We
                shall meet at the market square on the nineteenth of February, to overthrow
                tyrannical Hanſon for once and for all!
